# Terbit
A sedentary lifestyle is indirectly being adopted by people of all ages nowadays. Sedentary means a lifestyle that involves low levels of activity such as working in an office and sitting on a chair for long periods of time, and the like. Of course, if not balanced with other activities, this will have harmful effects on the body if left for a long time. The Terbit application aims to help users monitor and change their sedentary lifestyle through a series of monitoring and light tasks over a specified duration.
